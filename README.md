## LocalStorage and Operation

In this to do list the tasks are stored in the browser's localstorage, which means that your tasks are stored even if you reload the page.

You can create tasks and delete them as you wish, click on them and cross them out, you will see how when you do this, they will take a new style. 

At any time you can delete created tasks that were previously crossed out or not.

When you create a new task, it will always go to the top of the list.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
